# Robot-Learning
## This repository is still in progress!!
The main objective of this research is to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to real world robot applications. In the below picture, the robot is taught to recognize the speech and write the text (also performs math calculations)! The main objective of this research is to apply deep reinforcement learning algorithms to real world applications. In the picture, the robot is taught to recognize the speech, write the text and perform math calculations. There are several problems while performing this task and each task is knocked down one by one. The first problem is to make the robot navigate to reach the marker irrespective of its position. The learning process is carried out by leveraging the power of convolutional neural network in the reinforcement learning paradigm.  More details about the methodology and implementation can be found in my Github
